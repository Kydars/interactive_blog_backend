# Interactive Blog Backend

This repository contains the frontend component of an interactive blog based upon my journey to becoming a software engineer. The first step of my journey will begin with this project, as I learn how to correctly implement a database and file system in the backend, which will be deployed using AWS. I chose this stack because each framework/language appears to be the industry-standard.

# Frontend Stack
Deployment: AWS <br />
Frontend: React + Javascript <br />
